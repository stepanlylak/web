    <p>Hummingbirds live in Central, North and South America, as well as in the Caribbean, at an altitude of up to 5200 m above
        sea ​​level They are widespread in tropical forests, especially numerous in the middle mountains, instead in temperate ones
        only a few species live in these latitudes. The ranges of many species are limited to only one valley or mountain slope,
        some stretch in a narrow strip along the western or eastern slope of the Andes. There are many island endemics.
        In general, hummingbirds prefer biotopes rich in vegetation, but some species live mainly in
        deserts or semi-deserts. About half of hummingbird species live in the equatorial belt, within the band
        around the equator is 10 degrees wide, and many equatorial species do not live in the Amazon, but high in
        Andes, where the temperature drops significantly after sunset. The fiery baby hummingbird is the most common representative
        families in the west of North America, as well as the only hummingbird species recorded outside America, in Chukotka
        peninsula in Russia. The most species of hummingbirds are recorded in Colombia - 168 species, while in Ecuador - 135
        species, in Peru - 127 species, in Brazil - 85 species, in the USA - 31 species.
        At different altitudes, some taxa are replaced by ecologically similar ones. For example, the Mexican hermit (Phaethornis
        longirostris) at an altitude of more than 2,500 m above sea level are replaced by representatives of the Inca hummingbird genus (Coeligena).
        Coexistence of hummingbirds is possible by reducing intraspecific competition (different in weight and in
        morphological features of the species feed on the nectar of different plants) or vertical segregation (some species
        live in the understory, while others search for food in the middle and upper layers of the forest). In the areas of large species
        the diversity of hummingbirds is also important for each species-specific feeding strategies.
        Many species of hummingbirds easily adapt to changes in the natural environment, and under favorable conditions they can
        even expanding their ranges like ruby-headed calypta. At the same time, the population of other species can quickly
        decrease due to the destruction of the natural environment, as in the hermit hermit of Baguia (Glaucis dohrnii).</p>
